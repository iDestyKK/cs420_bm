# CS420 - Biologically-Inspired Computation

## Synopsis
COSC 420, 427, and 527 focus on *biologically-inspired computation*, including recent developments in computational methods inspired by nature, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms and other evolutionary computation systems, ant swarm optimization, artificial immune systems, swarm intelligence, cellular automata, and multi-agent systems.
