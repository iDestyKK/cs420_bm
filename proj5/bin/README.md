# Binary Files

## Synopsis
These are simply files that are pre-compiled in case the lack of proper compilation software is on the user's system.

### pso.exe
This is a GML executable that runs on Windows.
It was compiled with Game Maker 8.0 Pro.
It isn't the full simulator, but it provides a GUI to show what exactly is going on.
The values are hardcoded, and can only be modified in the original gmk source code located at `src/gml/pso.gmk`.
