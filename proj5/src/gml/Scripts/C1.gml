 * double C1(double x, double y);
 * 
 * Arguments:
 *     x - Particle Coordinate on X-Axis
 *     y - Particle Coordinate on Y-Axis
 *
 * Description:
 *     An equation... Plug it into wolfram if you really wanted to see what it
 *     does.
 *
 * Equation Summary:
 *     sin(y) * cos(x)
 *
 * Credits:
 *     Inspired by "Phillip Wells's Particle Swarm Optimization" simulator, over
