      <h2>Project 5 — Particle Swarm Optimization</h2>
    </center>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    The following is some guidance for the ranges of the parameters. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Number of particles:</b> A typical range is 20 to 40. For many
    problems, as few as 10 particles may be enough. For larger or more
    difficult problems, 100, 200, or more particles might be more
    appropriate. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Inertia:</b> Generally the range is [0, 1], typically very close
    to 1. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Cognition and social parameters:</b> Usually they are nearly
    equal and typically around 2, but they can range from 0 to 4. <br>
    <br>
    <b>World width and world height:</b> The range in the <i>x</i> and
    <i>y</i> directions, respectively. A good range is –50 to 50 in both
    directions. In that case, both the world width and height would be
    100. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Maximum velocity:</b> Limits how much a particle can move for a
    given iteration. Typical values to try are 1, 2, and 10. Some
    implementations define maximum velocity as the world width or
    height. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Data representation</h3>
    It’s probably easiest to keep the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
    coordinates in separate arrays/variables for position, velocity,
    personal best, and global best. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Initialization</h3>
    The position of each particle should be initialized to a random
    number in the range for each coordinate (e.g. between –50 and 50 in
    both directions). <br>
    <br>
    The velocity of each particle can be initialized to 0. <br>
    <br>
    The personal best for each particle can be initialized to that
    particle. <br>
    <br>
    The global best can be initialized to the particle with the best
    fitness, as given by the objective functions <code>Q(p)</code>
    (i.e. <code>Q(position)</code>). <br>
    <br>
    Of course, both the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates of each of
    these should be initialized. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Stopping condition for main update loop</h3>
    Keep iterating until the error in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
    coordinates drops below a certain threshold (e.g. 0.01). In case the
    system never fully converges, a second condition should be added,
    which is a maximum number of iterations. Both of these conditions
    can be given in a while loop. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Updating the particles</h3>
    Implement the following update rules: <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Velocity</h4>
    <code> velocity' = inertia * velocity + c_1 * r_1 *
      (personal_best_position - position) + c_2 * r_2 *
      (global_best_position - position) </code> <br>
    <br>
    where <code>c_1</code> is the cognition parameter, <code>c_2</code>
    is the social parameter, and <code>r_1</code> and <code>r_2</code>
    are random numbers in [0, 1]. <br>
    <br>
    The positions and velocities are actually vectors, so you would
    implement this formula for both the <i>x</i> and the <i>y</i>
    coordinates. <br>
    <br>
    The velocity needs to be scaled in order to keep it within range.
    Otherwise, the positions will become too large and often go out of
    bounds, and your program will behave wildly. The following is how to
    scale the velocity:<br>
    <br>
    <code> if </code><code><code>velocity_x<sup>2</sup> + velocity_y<sup>2</sup></code>
      &gt; maximum_velocity<sup>2</sup> <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;velocity = (maximum_velocity/sqrt(velocity_x<sup>2</sup>
      + velocity_y<sup>2</sup>)) * velocity </code> <br>
    <br>
    Again, do this for both the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates. <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Position</h4>
    <code> position' = position + velocity' </code> <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Personal best</h4>
    <code> if(Q(position) &gt; Q(personal_best_position)) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;personal_best_position = position </code> <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Global best</h4>
    <code> if(Q(position) &gt; Q(global_best_position)) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;global_best_position = position </code> <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Measuring performance</h3>
    At the very least, calculate the average error in the <i>x</i> and
    <i>y</i> coordinates of the particles. This can be done by <br>
    <br>
    <code> error_x += (position_x[k] - global_best_position_x)<sup>2</sup>
      <br>
      error_y += (position_y[k] - global_best_position_y)<sup>2</sup> </code>
    <br>
    <br>
    for each particle <i>k</i>. <br>
    <br>
    Then <br>
    <br>
    <code> error_x = sqrt((1/(2*num_particles))*error_x) <br>
      error_y = sqrt((1/(2*num_particles))*error_y) </code> <br>
    <br>
    This is the measure that should be included as part of your stopping
    condition. <br>
    <br>
    You can plot this error over the number of iterations to get a
    qualitative view of the performance. <br>
    <br>
    As mentioned in the Project 5 handout, you can also compute the
    percentage of particles that have converged to within a small
    distance of the global maximum. You can also plot this over the
    number of iterations. <br>
    <br>
    Number of epochs until convergence is another measure of
    performance. <br>
    <br>
    A purely qualitative assessment is to obtain a scatter plot of the
    particles after the updating iterations. Below are two examples of
    what you might see for Problem 2 (two maxima). In the first graph,
    most of the points have converged to the global maximum, although
    they are covered up by the global maximum point on the graph. <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    The more performance measures and graphs you analyze, the higher
    grade you can earn. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Neighborhood (local) best (graduate part)</h3>
    The requirement is to implement a ring topology with neighborhoods
    given by the 2-nearest neighbors. Define a permutation of the
    particles, where a particle’s neighbors are the array elements
    before and after it (allow for wraparound). You can use the position
    arrays as the permutation, where the neighbors are accessed by the
    array indices. The topology will not change during the iterations of
    the algorithm. That is, each particle will keep its same two
    neighbors throughout the iterations. <br>
    <br>
    The velocity formula is modified as follows: <br>
    <br>
    <code> velocity' = inertia * velocity + c_1 * r_1 *
      (personal_best_position - position) + c_2 * r_2 *
      (global_best_position - position) + c_3 * r_3 *
      (local_best_position - position) </code> <br>
    <br>
    The best neighbor is the particle whose <code>Q(position)</code> is
    the largest. <br>
    <br>
    You can try k-nearest neighbors for extra credit. For example,
    4-nearest neighbors are given by the 2 elements before and the 2
    elements after the given particle. <br>
    <br>
    For the Euclidean distance method (extra credit), the nearest
    neighbors of a particle are those that are within a given radius as
    measured by Euclidean distance. The radius is another parameter that
    can vary over a range of values. <br>
    <br>
    You can also try other topologies for extra credit, such as star or
    wheel. <br>
